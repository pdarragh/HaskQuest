# HaskQuest

/ˈhæs.kwɛst/

A Haskell-based domain-specific language for generating and playing text-based adventure games.

## Origin

HaskQuest (HQ) began as my final project for a functional programming course at the University of Utah taught by Dr Matt Flatt. I enjoy the challenges of parsing and interpreting and wanted to create a small language, and Dr Flatt suggested narrowing my language down to a specific goal.
